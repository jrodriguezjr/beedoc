# Contributing to Beego

## Introduction
Beego is free and open source software, which means that anyone can contribute to its development and progress. Beego's source code is hosted on github. Github provides a very easy way to fork the project and merge your contribution.

## Pull Requests\

### Things to know
A pull request process for new features and bugs are not the same. When you launch a new feature you should first create a `[the Proposal] ` title issue, prior to creating a pull request. The proposal should describe this new feature, as well a documention of the proposed implementaiton. Proposals will be reviewed, and may or may not be adopted. When a proposal is adopted, we will create an implementation of the new features of the pull request. Please note, not following these steps/guidelines may more than likely result in rejection of your proposal.

### Bugs
For bugs, please submit a pull request.  There is no need to create and issue. If you have a solution to the bug, please describe in detail your solution.

To encouracge faster modification of documentation, please know that you can also be submit your changes directly on [beedoc](https://github.com/beego/beedoc)ã€‚

### Submit new features

If you want to intergrate some new features into Beego, you can create an issue with [Request] title. The proposal will be reviewed by the core contributors.

### Beego Development Workflow
Now Beego adopts gitflow way of development, so the existing all development is on the develop branch, so all the pull request please send to develop branch.
